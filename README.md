# Script to help me make things easy on Windows XP

## Introduction

My computer use Windows7, but the computer that I used at my intern place use Windows XP. And that computer will clear all data on C drive when you restart it. So I keep all my data on D drive included Opera browser (Because opera browser now use webkit and it allows to be installed on a usb, that mean store all data on the usb drive), Sublime Text 3, and git.

I use this script doing three things.

1) Make opera the default browser. So when I click a html file, it will be opened by Opera not IE8.

2) Add a context menu "Open with Sublime Text". So when I right click a file, there will be an option on the context menus.

3) Add subl.exe and git.cmd to the `PATH` environment variable. So I can use git and subl on the command.

## Prerequisite

WindowsXP+
